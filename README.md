1. Write a query to retrieve the employee number and first name of the most senior
person at the company. (That is, the one who has no boss.) Note that no value is equal to
NULL, not even itself. But there is a special operation IS for checking whether or not a value is
NULL.
2. Write a query to retrieve the employee number and first name of each employee,
along with the employee number and first name of their boss. Name the latter two columns
mgrno and mgrfname. Sort the results alphabetically by the employee’s first name. Employees
that do not have a boss will not be included in the output.
3. Write a query to retrieve the names of all departments in which the average salary
of emloyees, excluding the manager of the department, is greater than $25,000.
4. Write a query to retrieve the employee number and first name of all employees
who have the same boss as the employee named Andrew. (Andrew himself will be part of the
results.) Do not look up Andrew’s employee number yourself, but make your query figure it
out.
5. Write a query to retrieve the employee number, first name, and salary of the person
who makes the most money among all people supervised by Andrew’s boss. (This might or
might not be Andrew.) Again, do not look up Andrew’s employee number yourself, but make
your query figure it out. Also, do not use the LIMIT feature.
6. Write a query to retrieve the employee number and first name of every employee
who is someone’s boss but does not manage a department.
7. Write a query to retrieve the product id, description, and price of the most expensive item that is a part of the Animal Photography Kit. Do not look up the product id of
the Animal Photography Kit yourself, but make your query figure it out. Also, do not use the
LIMIT feature.
